Input file is stored inside input.csv


This script has been tested on Python 3.
You can generate the schedule by:

 $ python3 soln.py


In a nutshell this is what the script does:

- Load all talks from input.csv into a list
- Shuffle the list
- Create 4 lists to represent 4 bins(Track 1 AM, Track 1 PM, Track 2 AM, Track 2 PM)
- Use First-First to try and pack in the talks into each session
- Check if final results meets the imposed constraints
- If yes, show the proposed schedule
- If not, keep generating a new set of talk order and loop until a valid schedule is found.
